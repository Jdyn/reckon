## TODO
- [ ] Implement "status bar" for bills
  - [ ] `$` rating based on the total of the bill 1-5 $ signs
  - [ ] This is where delete button can be for bill
    - Only deletable if the bill is not already complete.
  - [ ] should we add "liking" a bill?
  - [ ] should we add commenting on a bill?
- [ ] rework `SideMenu` to allow to be controlled from outside of the component.
