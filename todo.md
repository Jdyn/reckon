## TODO

- Bill Status bar
  - Delete bill
  - edit bill
  - `$$$` bill ratings
  - Maybe add commenting on a bill??
- Inviting users from the UI
  - Ignore rich user search for now

- Bill categories
  - Similar to Discord's channel categories
  - For groups, the left drawer gets populated by bills separated by custom group categories
  - For You, the left drawer gets populated by bills separated by group
  - The bills on the drawer are clickable and navigate the user to the bill.
    - Could make a separate bill page, or make it so it auto scrolls to the bill in the list??
- bill tags
  - custom tags per group that can be applied to individual bills. Things like 'rent', 'food', etc. would be useful

## Larger overhaul - Communities for Real Life
- Reimagine bills as "stories" that essentially tell a sequential story about an event from start to finish.
- This intuitively allows for more interesting features like commenting and adding pictures to "stories"
  - imagine a story is a dinner party, you can basically start the story before days in advance, even comment on it, then it happens, and you add all of the totals, and pictures to the story.
    - everyone added to the story can add pictures of the story throughout. Imagine everyone takes a picture of their plate and adds it to the story in the app. Tag each photo with who uploaded it
